Electronics Search & Ranking Microservice

Smart Data (Hybrid Core): I tried to scrape real data from Flipkart, but their security blocked it. Instead of giving up, I built a Hybrid Generator to create a high-quality list of 1,000+ products with real metrics like "units sold".

Hinglish Search: My search understands Indian shopping habits. If you type "Sasta iPhone," it knows you want the best deals and ranks the cheapest, high-rated phones at the top.

Fixes Typos: I added "Fuzzy Matching." If a user makes a mistake and types "Ifone" or "Samshung," the system is smart enough to show the right results anyway.
